# Vehicle-Detection-on-Video-Sequences-via-Subspace-Learning
In this repository, MATLAB codes of a novel vehicle detection algorithm is published. There is a related article on IEEE Xplore website and the adress of it can be found in the M-files of the algorithm. 
Before going further, you should know that only object detection codes of the study is published here.
